## If you want a random restaurant
1. Click the “Restaurants” button
2. Enter a valid location
   - If it contains invalid characters, you will receive an alert letting you know to enter a location without the characters.
   - If you receive any other error from the Yelp server, you will receive an alert that explains the error. You will then need to restart the app to try again.
3. Once the location is presented to you
   - you can go to the Yelp page by clicking the photo of the restaurant, name of the restaurant, or the address of the restaurant.
   - You can click the “Find another restaurant” button if you’d like to find another restaurant. You would repeat the process of entering a valid location.
   - You can also click the “Find a Youtube Video Instead” if you’d like to find a YouTube video instead. You would need to sign in if you haven’t already, or if
     your auth token wasn’t stored for any other reason. Otherwise, you’ll be presented with a video.
