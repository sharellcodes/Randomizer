# Features and Functions

## Summary
I created this app to practice my general Swift development skills, my ability to operate with popular APIs, and to continue exercising my general programming skills.

## Key Feature(s)

## General Programming Highlights

### Asynchronous Coding
- During the use of the URLSession API, the code within that closure isn’t running on the main thread. There were things that needed to be done within that closure, but could only be done on the main thread. Asynchronous was the solution.
- [An Example]()

### Regular Expressions
- Used for making sure the location that the user enters is a proper location string ([code]()).
